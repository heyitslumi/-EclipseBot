After .env edit config.json fully! Any non edited parameter can cause issues!
you can choose to toggle debug mode as it's on by default
Debug mode doesn't spam or so it just notifies about non critical errors that happened while loading a command


## How to edit code?
Simply make any changes you want to do, We recommand using node 21 or greater with discord.js v14, then simply just send a pull request with a quick description of what you did, any new additions and npm modules or different tools etc!
